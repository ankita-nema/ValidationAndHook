      summary: Access the full contact (the entire interaction with all segments) based on ACD Call ID (e.g., CXone ACD Master Contact ID). The ACD Call ID depends on the ACD solution, for example, this is the same as the CXone ACD Master Contact ID. **Keep in mind that using the ACD Call ID GET method, you can play back interactions recorded from December 13, 2018. Playing back an interaction recorded before December 13, 2018 will give an Interaction Not Found error.
